# Game-SNAKE-Project
Game i made

This is Game Snake. 
I draw a snake and a strawberry  by myself and push it into my window.

How to play: 
The snake moves by using the keyboard up, down, left, right.
Try to move the snake to eat strawberry, when the snake eats a strawberry, it will be longer.
If snake gets out of the window, you're lost.
If snake stabs into its body, you're lost.

In this project, i use SDL2. Because i use Xcode so #include <SDL2/SDL.h> doesn't work with my code. So I change into #include "/Library/Frameworks/SDL2.framework/Headers/SDL.h" so it succeeded. 

This is one of the part of my game, I will add more fuction in the future.

HAVE FUN!!!
