GAME SNAKE
This is one of my simple game SNAKE EVER!
THIS IS A GAME USING SDL 2.0 ON C++.

 In this project i use SDL2.framework which is set up in X-CODE on MACOS

HOW TO PLAY:
The snake moves by using the keyboard UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
Try to move the snake to eat strawberry, when the snake eats a strawberry, it will be longer.
If snake gets out of the screen, game's end.
If snake stabs into its body, game's end.

NOTE: I use the path to include the picture i draw on desktop.

HAVE FUN!!!
