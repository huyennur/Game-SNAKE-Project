# Game-SNAKE-Project
Game i made

This is Game Snake. 
I draw a snake and a strawberry  by myself and push it into my window.

How to play: 
The snake moves by using the keyboard up, down, left, right.
Try to move the snake to eat strawberry, when the snake eats a strawberry, it will be longer.
If snake gets out of the window, you're lost.
If snake stabs into its body, you're lost.

HAVE FUN!!!
